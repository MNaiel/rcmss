% This function implements a greedy association between two sets given a 
% score matrix. The method match two paris selecting the max and if the 
% score is higher than a given threshold.

%GREEDYASSOCIATION   association function
%   ASSIGNMENTMATRIX = GREEDYASSOCIATION(SCOREMATRIX,THRESHOLD) given a 
%   score matrix and a threshold returns the association matrix.
%   
%   - INPUT:
%   SCOREMATRIX is matrix where each item contains the score of a given
%   pair. The matri dimension is TxA where T is the number of Tracks and A
%   is the number of annotations.
%   THRESHOLD the threshold used to say that a pair matches.
%   - OUTPUT:
%   ASSIGNMENTMATRIX is the binary matrix of assignmenti. If a element is
%   one the method has made the assignment.
