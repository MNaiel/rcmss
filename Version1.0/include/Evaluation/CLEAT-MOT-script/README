 == A metric for multiple target tracking

A standard metric for evaluating the multiple target tracking algorithm is
the CLEAR MOT.  This metric is described in the paper [1] .

 == Details

We provide the code that implements the metric CLER-MOT has described by the
authors in [1]. The function is implemented in MATLAB and has been tested
on real data generated by a multiple-target tracker.

The tarball contains these MATLAB files:

- groundtruth.mat contains the labeled annotations of 3 objects. Objects are
	specificated by bounding box as [tl.x tl.y br.x br.y].
- result.mat contains the tracking results hypothesis as taken from the ground
	truth files.
- evaluateMOT.m is the function that perform the evaluation.
- main.m is the main file
- GreedyAssociation.m is the file that performs the association give the
	distance matrix. You can replace with other solver like Hungarian algorithm.
	These files are an example: if you want to use the script to evaluate you
	multiple target tracking, you have to recreate the structures groundtruth.mat
	and result.mat with your own data.

 == Demo Example

	>load groundtruth
	>load result
	>VOCscore = 0.5;
	>dispON  = true;
	>ClearMOT = evaluateMOT(gt,result,VOCscore,dispON);
