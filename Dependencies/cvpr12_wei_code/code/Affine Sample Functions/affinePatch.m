function [patch bb]= affinePatch(wimgs, patchsize, patchnum)
% function patch = affinePatch(wimgs, patchsize, patchnum)
% obtain M patches in each candidate

% input --- 
% wimgs: the N candidate images (matrix)
% patchsize: the size of each patch
% patchnum: the number of patches in one candidate

% output ---
% patch: the patches for N candidates (vector)
